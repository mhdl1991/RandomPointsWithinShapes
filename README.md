# RandomPointsWithinShapes
Trying to make a script that generates random points within shapes, mostly to see how to do it properly

* random_points.py contains a number of functions which can take x,y coordinates OR a number of coordinate tuples as parameters
* points_test.py is a pyglet thing that currently demonstrates random_points.py's functions for generating random points within a triangle and generating random points along a line
